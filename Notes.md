Topic: Main parts of a cell:
Cell membrane: controls entry and exit of substances.
Cytoplasm: jelly-like fluid where reactions happen.
Nucleus: contains DNA, controls the cell.
Mitochondria: make energy (ATP) through respiration.
Ribosomes: make proteins.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER): rough ER has ribosomes and makes proteins, smooth ER makes lipids.
Golgi apparatus: packages and ships proteins.
Lysosomes: break down waste (mainly in animal cells).
Vacuoles: store materials; large in plant cells.
Cell wall: supports plant cells.
Chloroplasts: do photosynthesis in plant cells.
